# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
This report will analyze trends for kickstarter campaigns in theater and plays, based on data in nine different categories of kickstarter campaigns across 21 countries. Special focus was placed on US theater campaigns looking at their financial goals, donations, pledge amount and success rates through the year.

### Purpose
To provide Lauren with an analysis of trends in US theater campaigns for informed business decisions on her own kickstarter campaign in this market. 
## Analysis and Challenges
Analysis were completed for Theatre outcomes based on launch dates and on campaign goals. One of the main challenges in creating this anaysis is trying to find correlation with time of year and goal amounts. Another challenge lies in smaller amounts of data in other countries, where most of the data has been collected for Unites States (US) kickstarters. Many outliers skewed the averages for donations and other financial datasets that exceeded in over $5,000. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
For outcomes based on launch date, this takes a look at the number of successes, failures and canceled campaigns against each month throughout the year. The highest amount of successes peaked in May. Notably, both failed and successful campaigns met nearly at the same point, reached it's lowest in December at the end of the year. Ideal times for successful campaigns correlate with the Spring months for the highest amount, and Winter for the lowest, failed campaigns follow a similar trend at lower amounts.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In analyzing the goal ranges for successful campaigns, the majority at 73%, had a goal ranging from $1,000 to $5,000. The second most successes had a goal ranging $1,000 or less. Failed campaigns also held a majority of their goals up to $5,000, and no theater kickstarter campaigns were canceled. Successful and failed campaigns work in opposite directions in their trends, intersecting at three points at significantly higher ranges.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Lauren wanted to compare and analyze the same theater categories in Great Britain. There isn't a substantial amount of data comparable to the US, however, some data may be comparable such as the goal versus pledged amounts for the plays subcategory. This shows that US campaign goals are almost twice as much as their pledged amounts. Great Britain showed goals that were within $1,000 of their pledged amounts. An important factor here is that data collected from the US in this category is about five times more than Great Britain. 

## Results
---
### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
1. Spring months are the ideal time to launch a kickstarter campaign, Winter months in the US may negatively affects their success. This could possible be affected by the holidays or other factors not shown in the data. 
2. There were no canceled kickstarter campaigns in theater.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
A majority of both successful campaigns had goals ranging up to $5,000. Higher amounts were significantly less frequent and did not correlate to success or failures but would affect the average amounts for both. Campaigns with goals less than $1,000 seem to be more successful.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

A distinguishing factor in the differences correlate with the amount of data gathered for both the United States (US) and Great Britain (GB). The US accounts for over 70% of the data gathered in this report. In turn, this data is skewed to the left in favor of the US campaigns, more data will be needed to compare theater campaigns in other countries. The data collected for the US is 5 times larger than collected for GB, all other countries have significantly less.

### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

Other charts we could create based on the data would be launch outcomes based on year to analyze differences, a subcategorical look at the type of plays (such as comedy, drama, historical fiction, etc.), a bar graph or pie chart of backer count for country, and an analysis of staff picks. A funding analysis by parent and subcategories could also be helpful to compare gaols by country. If age groups were available in the data, this could also help narrow down audience types for these campaigns.
