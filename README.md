Pledged amounts were significantly less compared to goals for the US, meeting less than $4,000, nearly half of the goals for the US. Goals and Pledges over $20,000 significantly bring up the averages for the US, but do not infuence the spread between pledges and goals.

### What We Noticed
A distinguishing factor in the differences correlate with the amount of data gathered for both the United States (US) and Great Britain (GB). The US accounts for over 70% of the data gathered in this report. In turn, this data is skewed to the left in favor of the US campaigns and more data will be needed to compare theatre campaigns in other countries.

### What We Recommend
For US theater campaigns, the ideal time of year to campaign will be in the Spring, with May having the most successful kickstarters. To meet financial goals, recommended targets between $4,000 and $4,500, make it more likely to line up with estimated pledges.
